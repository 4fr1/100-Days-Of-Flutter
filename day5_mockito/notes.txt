- Some unit tests depend on classes that fetch data e.g. from a web service or databases
- This is inconvenient because:
1) Calling live services or databases slows down test execution
2) A passing test may fail if the external dependency, e.g. a web service is down (aka a "flaky test")
3) It is difficult to test all possible success & failure scenarios by using a live web service or database
- Therefore you can mock these external dependencies
- You can write these alternative implementations (mocks) by hand or use Mockito as a shortcut

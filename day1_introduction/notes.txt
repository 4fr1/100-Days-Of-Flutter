- Unit testing only tests individual classes, functions & widgets
- Integration tests test how individual pieces work together as a whole
- flutter_driver package: used for creating instrumented apps
- Widgets can be accessed by instrumentation test by using the "key" parameter
- Integration test suites do not run in the same process as the app being tested
- Folder name convention for instrumentation tests: test_driver
- Then create two files; one for creating the instrumented version of the app,
    and another one which contains the test suite

Run tests command:
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart

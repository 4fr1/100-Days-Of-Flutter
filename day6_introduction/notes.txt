- To test individual widgets you need a few more tools, which are included in the flutter_test package
- WidgetTester() - building & interacting with widgets in a test environment
- testWidgets() - used instead of test() - also automatically creates a WidgetTester for each test
- Finder classes - used to search for widgets in the test environment
- Matcher constants
- pumpWidget() - builds and renders a specific widget inside the test environment
- Flutter does not automatically rebuild a widget in the test environment when setState() called
- Use tester.pump() or tester.pumpAndSettle() instead

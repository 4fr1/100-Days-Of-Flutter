- Performance is critical to UX in mobile apps
- stuttering or skipped frames = "jank"
- You can either test your app's performance manually or with instrumentation tests
- You can trace the performance of a test by using the traceAction() function that returns a Timeline object
- This object can be saved to a file for further analysis
